## Updating the installation list ##

The index.html in this directory contains the base template for the installation list page. It loads the CSV file from https://github.com/bugzilla/bugzilla.github.io/blob/master/_data/installation-list.csv in order to populate the data. To submit additions/removals/edits to the installation list, please edit that CSV file and submit a pull request.
