<h2 id="eol42">[ 2015 Jul 30 ] Bugzilla 4.2 will be EOL on 2015/11/30</h2>

<p>As discussed on the Bugzilla
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21topic/mozilla.dev.apps.bugzilla/vBGTf7SvOWg">
  developers mailing list/newsgroup</a> and confirmed by project leads,
  Bugzilla's new release policy is to end-of-life the oldest supported major
  version four months after a new major release. Since this is the first time
  we're enacting this policy, we've extended the date to be 4 months from today
  rather than from Bugzilla 5.0's exact release date (July 7th).
</p>

<p>Thus Bugzilla 4.2 will be end-of-lifed on 30 November 2015. This means no
  fixes of any kind will be issued for Bugzilla 4.2 from that date onwards. As
  usual, all Bugzilla admins are encouraged to
  <a href="https://bugzilla.readthedocs.org/en/5.0/installing/upgrading.html">upgrade</a>
  to the latest version of Bugzilla as soon as possible, especially those running
  4.2 or earlier.
</p>

<p>To expand a bit further on our new EOL process, after a new major release,
  we will support three major releases (including the new one) for four months.
  After four months, we will drop support for the oldest one.  We will continue
  to support the remaining two until four months after the next release.
</p>

<p>For example, currently we support 4.2, 4.4, and 5.0.  In four months' time we
  will drop support for 4.2 and support only 4.4 and 5.0.  When the next major
  version comes out, it may be 6.0 instead of 5.2 depending on the changes, we
  will support 4.4, 5.0, and 5.2.  Four months later, we will drop support for
  4.4 and support only 5.0 and 5.2.
</p>

<h2 id="release50">[ 2015 Jul 07 ] Release of Bugzilla 5.0</h2>

<p>Today the Bugzilla Project is extremely proud to announce the release of Bugzilla 5.0!</p>

<p>It has been slightly over two years since we released Bugzilla 4.4 on May 2013. This new
  major release comes with many new features and improvements to WebServices and performance.</p>

<p>We hope that you enjoy and appreciate the results of the past two years of hard work by our
  entirely-volunteer <a href="../developers/profiles.html">community</a>.</p>

<p>Bugzilla 5.0 will also be our first stable release to be only available 
  using Git. This means you will not be able to use bzr (Bazaar) anymore
  to upgrade to or install 5.0. The 4.0 branch is the last branch available
  on CVS, so any documentation referencing the use of CVS for installation
  or upgrading will no longer be valid. For more information, check the

  Notice about a user data leak from landfill.bugzilla.org</h2>

<p>Some email addresses and encrypted passwords for test builds on landfill.bugzilla.org were
  temporarily posted on a publicly accessible server.</p>

<p>One of our developers discovered that, starting on about May 4th, 2014, for a period of around
  3 months, during the migration of our testing server for test builds of the Bugzilla software,
  database dump files containing email addresses and encrypted passwords were posted on a publicly
  accessible server. This resulted in the accidental disclosure of the email addresses and encrypted
  passwords of about 97,000 users. As soon as we became aware, the database dump files were removed
  from the server immediately, and we’ve modified the testing process to not require the database
  dumps.</p>

<h2 id="release40">[ 2011 February 15 ] Release of Bugzilla 4.0!</h2>

  <p>Today the Bugzilla Project is extremely proud to announce the release
    of Bugzilla 4.0, the most exciting new version of Bugzilla in our
    history.</p>

  <p>Following on the heels of Bugzilla 3.6, Bugzilla 4.0 brings many
    fantastic new features and user interface improvements, including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A fully-redesigned 
      <a href="https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-4.0-branch/query.cgi?format=advanced">Advanced Search page</a></li>
    <li>Automatic duplicate detection when filing bugs</li>
    <li>Drop-down autocomplete for every field that accepts a user
      name or email address</li>
    <li>Full control and retrieval of bugs via the WebService,
      including updating existing bugs</li>
    <li>Redesigned home page icons from 
      <a href="http://www.jpink.co.uk/">J. Pink Design</a></li>
    <li>Numerous usability improvements</li>
    <li>and 
      <a href="../releases/4.0/release-notes.html#v40_feat">much, much more...</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Compared to Bugzilla 3.0, which we released in 2007, Bugzilla 4.0
    is a tremendous leap forward, with almost all the rough edges
    polished off, a huge number of new features, and almost every UI
    updated and improved.</p>

  <p>Bugzilla 4.0 is our best release ever, and we hope that you enjoy
    and appreciate the results of these last several months of hard work by our 
    entirely-volunteer <a href="../developers/profiles.html">community</a>.</p>

  <h3>EOL for 3.2.x</h3>

  <p>Please note that the release of Bugzilla 4.0 also marks End Of Life
    for the Bugzilla 3.2 series, meaning that there will be no further
    updates for the 3.2.x series, even if there are serious security
    issues found in that series. We recommend that all installations
    running the 3.2 series upgrade as soon as possible to 4.0.</p>

  <p>Some serious security issues were discovered in Bugzilla, and as a
    result we have four security releases for you today. We recommend that all
    Bugzilla administrators read the
    <a href="../security/3.2.9/">Security Advisory</a> that was
    published along with these releases, and that you update as soon
    as possible.</p>

  <p><a href="../releases/4.0/">Bugzilla 4.0rc2</a> is
    our second Release Candidate for Bugzilla 4.0. This
    release has received QA testing, and should be considerably more stable
    than the development releases before it. It is still not considered
    fully stable, and so you should understand that if you use it, you use
    it at your own risk.</p>

  <p>If feedback from this release candidate indicates that it is mostly
    stable, then Bugzilla 4.0 will be released in a few
    weeks. If feedback indicates that more extensive fixes are needed, there
    may be another release candidate after this one.</p>

  <p><a href="../releases/3.6.4/">Bugzilla 3.6.4</a> is our latest
    stable release. It contains various useful bug fixes in addition
    to the security patches. This is likely to be the last bug-fix release
    in the 3.6 series. Once Bugzilla 4.0 is released, the 3.6 series
    will only get security fixes.</p>

  <p><a href="../releases/4.0/">Bugzilla 4.0rc1</a> is

    than the development releases before it. It is still not considered
    fully stable, and so you should understand that if you use it, you use
    it at your own risk. In particular, certain aspects of the WebServices
    have not yet been tested as part of this Release Candidate, so they
    may change before the final release.</p>

  <p>If feedback from this release candidate indicates that it is mostly

  <p><strong>Bugzilla Extensions</strong></p>

  <p>One of the most exciting new features of Bugzilla 3.6 is
    <a href="../docs/3.6/en/html/api/Bugzilla/Extension.html">Extensions</a>.
    These are self-contained files that you can "drop in" to a Bugzilla
    installation to add new features or change Bugzilla's behavior, without
    modifying <em>any</em> existing code! Anybody can write and distribute their
    own Extension--Bugzilla 3.6 includes
    <a href="../docs/3.6/en/html/api/Bugzilla/Extension.html">very
    detailed documentation</a> on how to write and distribute Extensions, and
    even includes a script that will set up the framework of a new Extension
    for you so that you can get right to coding.</p>

  <p>Bugzilla 3.6 ships with one simple Extension that you can enable,
    and there are also already <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Addons#Bugzilla_Extensions">a few publicly-available Extensions for Bugzilla 3.6</a>,
    that any Bugzilla 3.6 installation can install to add new functionality
    to their system.</p>

  <p>Some developers have been using pre-release versions of the new Extensions
    system in Bugzilla 3.6, and here's what they have to say about it:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><q>Bugzilla Extensions really help me to do my customizations,
      giving me flexibility and reducing the impact in the tool's core.
      Congratulations Bugzilla team!</q> -Tiago Mello, IBM Linux Technology
      Center.</li>
    <li><q>With the new Extensions system, I can change almost any part of the
      UI without having to worry about upgrades. Plus, the Extension
      installation directions are super simple! Making usability tweaks for
      Bugzilla just got a lot easier.</q> -Guy Pyrzak, UI Designer</li>
    <li><q>Writing Bugzilla Extensions is some of the most fun I've had
      programming in years.</q> -Max Kanat-Alexander, Assistant Project
      Lead, Bugzilla Project.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We look forward to seeing what you do with the new Extensions system!</p>

  <p><strong>End of Life: Bugzilla 3.0.x</strong></p>

  <p>With the release of Bugzilla 3.6, the Bugzilla 3.0.x series has reached
   End Of Life. This means that there will be no new releases in the 3.0.x
   series, even if serious security issues are discovered in 3.0.x. Bugzilla
   3.0.11 is the last Bugzilla 3.0.x version that will be released. We
   strongly recommend that any Bugzilla installation still running Bugzilla
   3.0.x promptly upgrade to Bugzilla 3.6.</p>

  Release of Bugzilla 3.6rc1 and 3.4.6</h2>

  <p><a href="../releases/3.6/">Bugzilla 3.6rc1</a> is
    our first Release Candidate for Bugzilla 3.6. This
    release has received QA testing, and should be considerably more stable
    than the development releases before it. It is still not considered
    fully stable, and so you should understand that if you use it, you use
    it at your own risk.</p>

  <p>If feedback from this release candidate indicates that it is mostly
    stable, then Bugzilla 3.6 will be released in a few
    weeks. If feedback indicates that more extensive fixes are needed, there
    may be another release candidate after this one.</p>

  <p>Since this is a Release Candidate, it includes Release Notes and
    a listing of New Features. Make sure to check out the
    "Other Enhancements and Changes" section in particular--there are
    a lot of great improvements listed in there!</p>

<h3>EOL For Bugzilla 2.22</h3>

<p>The release of Bugzilla 3.4 marks the End Of Life for the Bugzilla 2.22.x
  series. This means that there will be no further updates released for
  Bugzilla 2.22.x, even if there are security holes found in that release.
  If you are running Bugzilla 2.22.x, we recommend that you upgrade to
  3.4 immediately.</p>

<p>Instructions for upgrading Bugzilla are in the 
  <a href="../docs/3.4/en/html/upgrade.html">Upgrading section of the
  Bugzilla Guide</a>. You should also read the 
  <a href="../releases/3.4/release-notes.html#v34_upgrading">Notes for

  that if you use it, you use it at your own risk. However, it should be
  fine for smaller or non-critical production installations.</p>

<p>If feedback from this release candidate indicates that it is mostly

  use of a two new problem-tracking systems. These new systems are based on 
  Bugzilla, with customizations by
  <a href="http://www.everythingsolved.com/">Everything Solved</a>
  and the <a href="http://hci.arc.nasa.gov/">NASA Ames Research Center
  Human-Computer Interaction Group</a>,
  with support from the <a href="http://www.sjsufoundation.org/">San Jose
  State University Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>The first piece of software is called 
  <a href="https://cxpraca.nasa.gov/">PRACA</a> (the Problem Reporting
  and Corrective Action System), and it is used to track problems
  discovered while building and testing shuttle components, so that mission
  control and various NASA departments can have problem-solving information
  at their fingertips.</p>

<p>PRACA will also be used for the future Constellation space program due
  to begin in 2010. It will replace 40 different database systems at 
  various different departments of NASA, centralizing problem tracking for 
  the Constellation program.</p>

<p>Another system based on Bugzilla, <a href="https://ifi.iss.nasa.gov/">IFI</a>
  (Items for Investigation), is used for tracking in-flight problems 
  during International Space Station missions.</p>

<p>NASA has been an active contributor to the Bugzilla Project, funding
  the development of numerous upstream features in Bugzilla, including
  all of the <a href="../releases/3.2/new-features.html#v32_feat_fields">new
  custom field types</a> that will appear in <a href="../releases/3.2/">Bugzilla
  3.2</a>, and even more custom field features that will appear in Bugzilla
  3.4.</p>

<p>The Bugzilla Project is proud that it has been able to play such an
  important role in mankind's exploration of space. We are happy that
  our open-source software may one day help us reach the stars.</p>

<h2><a name="release32rc2"></a>[ 2008 November 06 ] Release of Bugzilla
  3.2rc2, 3.0.6, 2.22.6, and 2.20.7</h2>

<p>Today there are four releases of Bugzilla!</p>

<p>The biggest release is <a href="../releases/3.2/">Bugzilla 3.2rc2</a>.
  There have been a lot of changes since 3.2rc1, particularly in the UI,
  so we wanted to put out another release candidate to get feedback. If
  all goes well with this release candidate, it should become 3.2 final in
  a few weeks with very few changes. 3.2rc2 is stable enough to use in
  small production environments, but major installations should wait for
  3.2 final before upgrading.</p>

  <li>See a list of <a href="../releases/3.2/new-features.html">New
    Features</a> in 3.2</li>
</ul>

<p>We fixed a security bug in all releases that are coming out today, so
  there is also a <a href="../security/2.20.6/">Security Advisory</a> to
  read.</p>

<p>Other than 3.2rc2, there are three other releases:
  <a href="../releases/3.0.6/">3.0.6</a>, 
  <a href="../releases/2.22.6/">2.22.6</a>, and 
  <a href="../releases/2.20.7/">2.20.7</a>. 3.0.6 has some minor bug fixes,
  2.22.6 brings Perl 5.10 compatibility to the 2.22 series, and 2.20.7
  is just a security release.</p>

<h2><a name="release313"></a>[ 2008 February 1 ] Release of Bugzilla
  3.1.3</h2>

<h3>3.1.3</h3>

<p><a href="../releases/3.2/">Bugzilla 3.1.3</a> has had massive changes: 
  among those, a fresh new user interface for editing bugs and experimental
  support for Oracle databases (caution: read the 
  <a href="../status/2008-02-01.html">Status Update</a> before using Oracle
  with Bugzilla). This release should be considered unstable and only
  used in testing environments.</p>

<h2><a name="release303"></a>[ 2008 January 8 ] Release of Bugzilla
  3.0.3</h2>

<h3>3.0.3</h3>

<p><a href="../releases/3.0.3/">Bugzilla 3.0.3</a> is the last stable release

 <li>Read the <a href="../releases/3.0.3/release-notes.html">Release Notes</a>

</ul>

<p>There is no development release at this time, as the current CVS HEAD
  code is not stable enough even for a development release.</p>

<h2><a name="release302"></a>[ 2007 September 18 ] Release of Bugzilla
  3.0.2 and 3.1.2</h2>

<p>We have two new releases, primarily to fix an important security issue
  discovered in the 3.0.x and 3.1.x series.</p>

<h3>3.0.2</h3>

<p><a href="../releases/3.0.2/">Bugzilla 3.0.2</a> contains the security

</ul>

<h3>3.1.2</h3>

<p><a href="../releases/3.2/">Bugzilla 3.1.2</a> also contains the 
  security fix, but just like 3.1.1, it has had massive changes and

<h2><a name="release301"></a>[ 2007 August 23 ] Release of Bugzilla 3.0.1,

<p>Today the Bugzilla project has four releases!</p>

<h3>3.0.1</h3>

<p><a href="../releases/3.0.1/">Bugzilla 3.0.1</a> is the first bug-fix 
release for the 3.0 series. 3.0 was very stable, but 3.0.1 adds a lot of
little polish fixes that greatly improve the experience of using Bugzilla.</p>

</ul>

<h3>3.1.1</h3>

<p><a href="../releases/3.2/">Bugzilla 3.1.1</a> is our first development
release toward Bugzilla 3.2. It has a huge number of new features, but is
<strong>extremely unstable</strong>. It has not been tested, and should not 
be used in a production environment. It may fail in critical ways, or destroy
your data. However, it is useful as a feature preview and for testing
purposes.</p>

<h3>2.22.3 and 2.20.5</h3>

<p><a href="../releases/2.22.3/">Bugzilla 2.22.3</a> and 
<a href="../releases/2.20.5/">Bugzilla 2.20.5</a> are security-fix and
critical bug-fix releases for the 2.22 and 2.20 series. If you are using
any 2.22 or 2.20 version, we strongly recommend you update to these
versions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bugzilla 2.20.5</strong>: 
    <a href="../download/#v220">Download</a> and read the

<h3>Security Advisory</h3>

<p>All four releases also contain security fixes, and so you should
definitely update if you want your installation to remain secure.
Read the <a href="../security/2.20.4/">Security Advisory</a> for more
details.</p>

<h2><a name="release30"></a>[ 2007 May 09 ] Release of Bugzilla 3.0!</h2>

<p>In 1998, the first open-source version of Bugzilla, 2.0, was
  released to the world without much fanfare, just 
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/netscape.public.mozilla.announce/browse_thread/thread/b52aa841db9f7e9b/f10c0f781841f10d#f10c0f781841f10d">this little post</a>
  on the <kbd>netscape.public.mozilla.announce</kbd> newsgroup.</p>

<p>Nine years later, Bugzilla is used by thousands of companies around the
  world with millions of total users. It has become the de-facto standard
  in open-source bug tracking. Thousands of companies have moved away
  from their costly commercial bug-tracking systems to Bugzilla, usually
  finding Bugzilla more flexible and more full-featured than 
  the system they'd been paying thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars
  for, and proving that open source software really can produce a competitive
  product.</p>

<p>Today, the Bugzilla Project is extremely proud to announce the
  release of <a href="../releases/3.0">Bugzilla 3.0</a>, and just
  like Terry said in 1998, "We like the new version much better,
  and hope you will too."</p>

<p>Here's just a sampling of the major new features in version 3.0:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Custom Fields</li>
  <li>mod_perl support for greatly-improved performance</li>
  <li>Per-Product Permissions</li>
  <li>XML-RPC Interface</li>
  <li>Create and Modify Bugs by Email</li>
  <li>and <a href="../releases/3.0/new-features.html">much, much 
    more...</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Bugzilla 3.0 also has a much-improved code base over previous versions
  of Bugzilla. Improvements are still happening, but long-time customizers
  and coders of Bugzilla will notice significant improvements. And if
  you haven't seen Bugzilla code since 2.16 or so, prepare to be 
  (pleasantly) surprised!</p>

<p>As always, we welcome open source <a href="../contribute/">contributors</a>
  to Bugzilla, which is made entirely by volunteers around the world.
  You too can be part of the team that makes a product used by thousands
  of people daily.</p>

<h2>[ 2007 February 26 ] Release of Bugzilla 3.0rc1</h2>

<p>We've released our first Release Candidate of Bugzilla 3.0,
  <a href="../releases/3.0/">Bugzilla 3.0rc1</a>!
  This is a major step towards our final release, and with your

<h2>[ 2007 Feb 02 ] Release of Bugzilla 2.22.2, 2.20.4, and 2.23.4</h2>

</ul>

<p>We also released <a href="../releases/2.20.4/">Bugzilla 2.20.4</a>,
  a security-fix release for the 2.20 series.</p>

<p>Finally, you can use <a href="../releases/2.24/">Bugzilla 2.23.4</a>
  in your testing environments. 2.23.4 is fairly stable, since it's
  currently running on 
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">bugzilla.mozilla.org</a>, but
  it still hasn't gone through QA yet, so it may have unfound critical
  issues.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="../security/2.20.3/">Security Advisory</a>
  for all three releases. Please read it, particularly if you
  were using 2.23.3.</p>

<h2>[ 2006 October 15 ] Release of Bugzilla 2.18.6, 2.20.3, 2.22.1,

  <li><a href="../releases/2.18.6/">Bugzilla 2.18.6</a> and 
    <a href="../releases/2.20.3/">Bugzilla 2.20.3</a> are security-fix
    releases for our older branches. (Bugzilla 2.20.3 also contains some
    non-security bug fixes.)</li>
  <li><a href="../releases/2.22.1/">Bugzilla 2.22.1</a> is our first bug-fix
    release in the 2.22 series, and contains many useful fixes that improve 
    the experience of using Bugzilla.</li>
  <li>Finally, we are releasing an unstable development snapshot, 
    <a href="../download/#v224">Bugzilla 2.23.3</a>. This snapshot has both 
    custom fields and mod_perl support, but has not been tested as thoroughly
    as our other releases. The 2.23 series will eventually culminate in 
    Bugzilla 3.0.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, read our latest <a href="../status/2006-10-15.html">Status Update</a> 
  to find out what's going on with the Bugzilla Project, and learn about all

  in the Status Update.</p>

<h2>[ 2006 July 09 ] Release of Bugzilla 2.23.2</h2>

<p>Today we have a new development snapshot for you, Bugzilla 2.23.2.
  It has a lot of improvements and changes since 2.23.1, so we wanted
  to get it out and get it tested!</p>

<p>However, remember that this is a development release, and so
  it has <strong>not been thoroughly tested</strong>. You should only use
  it in a testing environment!</p>

  <a href="../releases/2.24/">Bugzilla 2.23.1</a>, the branch which will 
  someday be released as 2.24 or 3.0.  This snapshot is <strong>not 
  tested</strong>, and should only be installed in a test environment.
  It's entirely possible that it contains a bug which will delete your 
  entire bug database. Or, it could be perfectly safe.  Since it hasn't
  been tested, nobody knows for sure. You Have Been Warned.</p>

<p>There is no release on the Bugzilla 2.16 branch, because it was not
   affected by any of the security issues. 2.16 users should note that
   support for 2.16 will be totally discontinued with the release of
   Bugzilla 2.22, and so they are encouraged to ugprade to Bugzilla 2.20
   as soon as possible.</p>

The Bugzilla Team has released Bugzilla 2.14.5 today to address two security
issues which were recently discovered.  As we've been warning for the last
several months, we are no longer supporting the 2.14 branch as of the end of

already done so are strongly encouraged to upgrade to 2.16.2 so you can
continue to receive security updates.

<h2>[ 2002 Jul 28 ] Bugzilla 2.16 Released</h2>

<p>
  The Bugzilla Team is relieved and pleased to finally announce the release of
  Bugzilla 2.16, and also a new
  <a href="../status/2002-07-28.html">status update</a>. 
  The product of 11 months of hard work, Bugzilla 2.16 is the
  first release of Bugzilla to have a templatised UI, allowing administrators
  easily to customise the look and feel of their Bugzilla without editing
  Perl code.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://groups.google.com/groups?q=&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;selm=p05111a01b969ca075018%40%5B192.168.1.203%5D&amp;rnum=1">Release announcement</a></li>

  <li><a href="../download/">Download page</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
  There are no security fixes in 2.16 that were not in 2.16rc2 - but anyone
  running a version of Bugzilla older than that needs to read the
  <a href="../security/2.14.2/">2.16rc2 and 2.14.2 security advisory</a> 
  and previous advisories. Bugzilla 2.16 is the best Bugzilla, and the
  Bugzilla team strongly recommends its use over all other versions.
</p>

<h2>[ 2002 Jul 28 ] Bugzilla 2.14.3 Released</h2>

<p>
  Due to a small "brown bag" issue in 2.14.2, 2.14.3 has been released. 
  This release contains two extra fixes to 2.14.2 - we fixed column sorting
  in buglists, and made a system call in the optional, unsupported, contributed
  email subsystem more secure.
</p>

<p>
  The 2.14.x branch is Bugzilla's older stable branch. New installations
  and upgraders are strongly recommended to use 2.16.
